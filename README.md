# React-Redux Walkthrough

Example of Redux architecture in form of an Employee List application with filtering.

## The Goal

> Once you realize that the road is the goal and that you are always on the road, not to reach a goal, but to enjoy its beauty and its wisdom, life ceases to be a task and becomes natural and simple, in itself an ecstasy. [Nisargadatta Maharaj]

Replacing the word 'life' with 'development' will make the real purpose of this repository clear :)

The repos is accompanied by a series of posts that mark the road to my understanding of how React-Redux works.

## Posts and branches

Each of the enlisted posts is illustrated by a separate branch.

`master` branch reflects the latest development state of the application.

Check the posts for the detailed description:

* 01-introduction (branch) - introduction into the Redux architecture, main building blocks and the data flow.
